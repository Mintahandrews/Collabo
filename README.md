## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codemintah/collabo.git
cd collabo
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# or
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Deploying to Render

Collabo can be easily deployed to [Render](https://render.com) with WebSocket support.

1. **Fork or clone this repository**

2. **Create a new Web Service on Render**
   - Sign in to your Render account
   - Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub/GitLab account or provide the repository URL

3. **Configure the service**
   - **Name:** Choose a name for your service
   - **Environment:** Node
   - **Region:** Choose the region closest to your users
   - **Branch:** main (or your preferred branch)
   - **Build Command:** `chmod +x ./render-build.sh && ./render-build.sh`
   - **Start Command:** `npm run start:render`
   - **Instance Type:** Choose based on your needs (Starter is good for beginning)

4. **Add environment variables**
   - `NODE_ENV`: production
   - `PORT`: 3000
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Your Render service URL (e.g., https://collabo-web.onrender.com)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL`: Same as your app URL (e.g., https://collabo-web.onrender.com)

5. **Enable WebSockets**
   - In your service settings, scroll down to "WebSockets"
   - Toggle "Enable WebSockets" to On

6. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Render will automatically deploy your application

7. **Troubleshooting Deployment Issues**
   - If you see a "Cannot find module './render-config'" error, verify the import path in `server/index.ts` uses `"./render-config"` (not `"../server/render-config"`)
   - Check that you're using the Render-specific start command (`npm run start:render`) which correctly handles the working directory
   - If you encounter a CSS build error with `caniuse-lite` (`Cannot find module './features/cross-document-view-transitions'`), the deployment includes fixes for this:
     - Modified PostCSS configuration to remove autoprefixer dependency
     - Added a patching script to handle missing features
     - Used package overrides to lock caniuse-lite to a compatible version
   - Verify that all environment variables are set correctly in the Render dashboard
   - For other issues, check the detailed troubleshooting guide in `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`

8. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - This project includes a `render.yaml` file for Infrastructure as Code deployment
   - You can use this file to create and configure your Render services automatically

For subsequent deployments, Render will automatically redeploy when you push changes to your repository.

### Render Deployment Checklist

1. Environment variables (in Render dashboard):
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=3000`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://<your-service>.onrender.com`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://<your-service>.onrender.com`

2. Commands (Service Settings):
   - Build: `chmod +x ./render-build.sh && ./render-build.sh`
   - Start: `npm run start:render`
   - WebSockets: enabled
   - Health check path: `/health`

3. Validate after deploy:
   - Browser: visit `https://<your-service>/health` (expects 200 JSON)
   - Polling: `curl -i "https://<your-service>/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling"`
   - DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí WS: confirm `transport=websocket` upgrades (101). If WS fails, polling requests should still return 200 (no 502).

4. If you see 502s or websocket errors:
   - Confirm env vars are set exactly to your service URL
   - Ensure the service is using the custom build script and `start:render`
   - Check logs for socket diagnostics (transport, upgrades, disconnect reasons)
   - Retry with client transports forced to polling to isolate upgrade issues
