# Render Deployment Changes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Module Resolution Error
The main issue was with the import path for `render-config.js` which was causing the "Cannot find module './render-config'" error during deployment. This has been fixed by:
- Changing the import path in `server/index.ts` from `"../server/render-config"` to `"./render-config"` to ensure correct module resolution after TypeScript compilation

### 2. Build and Start Scripts
The following scripts were updated to ensure proper deployment:
- Build script: Properly cleans and rebuilds all necessary files
- Start script: Now correctly handles the working directory in Render's environment

### 3. Render-Specific Configuration
- Added a Render-specific start script in `package.json` (`start:render`)
- Updated the `render.yaml` file to use the Render-specific start command

### 4. Debugging Improvements
- Added additional logging in the server code to help identify any issues during startup
- Created a `start:debug` script with verbose logging for troubleshooting

## Testing
All fixes were tested locally to verify:
- Build process completes successfully
- The render-config.js file is correctly included in the build
- The built server runs without any module resolution errors
- Socket configuration is correctly loaded

## Environment Variables
Make sure the following environment variables are set in your Render dashboard:
- `NODE_ENV`: production
- `PORT`: 3000 (or as desired)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Your Render app URL (e.g., https://collabo-web.onrender.com)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL`: Same as your app URL

## Deployment Instructions
1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Follow the deployment instructions in README.md
3. Monitor the deployment logs in Render dashboard for any issues

## WebSocket Support
WebSocket support has been properly configured with:
- Appropriate CORS settings
- Transport options for both WebSocket and polling
- Proper ping interval settings for stable connections
